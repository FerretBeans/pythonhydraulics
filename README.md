# pythonhydrolics
i really dont like python but my club uses it so whatever
this is just to move like syringe heads to push the stuff
i dont like it at all but im kinda forced to because money is cool



### **TODO**
- [ ] Make a grippy thingy
- [ ] Code the python file
- [ ] Get batteries for it
- [ ] Maybe create a document for it that I can link here
